 * Hello fellow coder! If you're reading this, it means that you love Countdown as much as I do!
 *
 * If you don't know what countdown is, don't worry! let me explain:
 *          . Countdown is a game where you are given a set of random 9 letters including "Vowels" and  "Consonants"
 *          . You then have 30 seconds to come up with the best word (longest) in 30 seconds.
 *
 * In this challenge you will have to come up with a function that will take in a 9 letter word named "vowelCounter" which takes in a 9 letter word and return the number of vowels in the letter
 *
 *Note:
 * - your vowels are  'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. DO NOT COUNT Y AS A VOWEL!
 * - The words should have exatcly 9 characters (since we are all amazing at countdown and come up with 9 letter words with any set of given letters).
 * - No special characters or numbers allowed. Only alphabets are permitted.
 * - Words can start from any alphabet.
 * - Capitalisation does not matter. "Adulthood" is the same as "adulthood".
 * - Your output will be a number between 1 AND 5.
 *
 *
 * a few examples to fully understand the task:
 *     `vowelCounter(textbooks)` should return 3  since 'e', 'o' * 2 are vowels
 *     `vowelCounter(AGREEMENT)` should return 4 since 'A', 'E' * 3  are all vowels
 */
export function vowelCounter(word) {
  //GOOD LUCK
}
