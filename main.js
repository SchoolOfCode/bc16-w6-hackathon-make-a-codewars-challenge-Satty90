 * Hello fellow coder! If you're reading this, it means that you love Countdown as much as I do!
 *
 * If you don't know what countdown is, don't worry! let me explain:
 *          . Countdown is a game where you are given a set of random 9 letters including "Vowels" and  "Consonants"
 *          . You then have 30 seconds to come up with the best word (longest) in 30 seconds.
 *
 * In this challenge you will have to come up with a function that will take in a 9 letter word named "consonantsCounter" which takes in a 9 letter word and return the number of consonants in the letter
 *
 *Note:
 * - The words should be English.
 * - No special characters or numbers allowed. Only alphabets are permitted.
 * - Words can start from any alphabet.
 * - Capitalisation does not matter. "Adulthood" is the same as "adulthood".
 * - Your output will be an integer.
 * - duplicate letters will not be counted twice
 *
 * a few examples to fully understand the task:
 *     `consonantsCounter(textbook)` should return 4  since 't', 'x', 'b', 'k' are all consonants
 *     `consonantCounter(WHICHEVER)` should return 5
 * since 'w', 'h', 'c', 'v', 'r'  are all consonants

export function consonantCounter(word) {
  //GOOD LUCK
}
